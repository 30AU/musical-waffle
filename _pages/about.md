The title **Thornbill's Nest** comes from one of Australia’s smallest and most understated birds, Yellow Thornbill, Acanthiza nana. The thornbill’s untidy, domed nest— woven from bark shreds, grass, tendrils, moss and lichen, bound with spiders' web — offers a fitting metaphor for scholarship and writing. Just as the bird gathers fragments from its environment to build a secure home, this blog collects ideas, sources, and reflections into a coherent space.

While the bird itself may not directly connect to every theme explored here, it provides a symbolic anchor: resilience in small voices, careful construction, and the quiet persistence of inquiry. The nest is both a literal structure in the canopy and a figurative one for thought, making the thornbill an apt namesake for this collection of work.
